The best way to be sucessful in this course is to be on top of your work. I know that sounds obvious and you should apply it to every class but for this class especially it matters a lot because what I struggled with was not really realizing I had work to do because it never felt like I did and I was so preoccupied with my other couses that I started feeling more and more behind. 
Also this class in my opinion is a class thats more important than any calculus class you will take because you actually need to understand how to use github since it is so prevalent in companies today.

The best way to be successfull with this course is, and I know how obvious this is, paying attention. Just going through the motions in the class without really paying attention you will miss the entire point of the class. Almost everything you will learn in this class seems to be used everywhere in the real world and knowing it will give you a leg up. With how overwhelming the first couple classes may seem because most people have 0 prior knowledge on this stuff paying attention is very important.

A side note though is, it won't really seem like you have that much work to do but it can pile up extremely fast. Do the practice badges thrughout the semester, even if you don't get all of them done even getting through the majority will remove a massive burden on your shoulders at the end of the semester/
