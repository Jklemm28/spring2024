# Testimonials from Spring 2024 Students

The best way to be successfull with this course is, and I know how obvious this is, paying attention. Just going through the motions in the class without really paying attention you will miss the entire point of the class. Almost everything you will learn in this class seems to be used everywhere in the real world and knowing it will give you a leg up. With how overwhelming the first couple classes may seem because most people have 0 prior knowledge on this stuff paying attention is very important.

A side note though is, it won't really seem like you have that much work to do but it can pile up extremely fast. Do the practice badges thrughout the semester, even if you don't get all of them done even getting through the majority will remove a massive burden on your shoulders at the end of the semester/
